Task: Write unit test code for the corresponding test case for a JS function or class

Instructions:
1. Accurately write the test function based on the test case description
2. Mock every needed function called inside the tested function/class (except for the function and modules that you do not have access to)
3. If there are recursive calls to the function being tested, do not mock the tested function itself and try to handle the recursion in the test
4. Complete or override parameters declared in beforeEach (if present) to fit the test case description
5. Avoid using jest.mock to mock the whole module (as the path given in the template is a placeholder), instead use jest.spyOn to mock specific functions
6. Unit test code should consist of a single test function matching the test case description with setup and cleanup inside of it
7. Your answer must only include the test function, not the whole unit test file

Tested code extract:
```javascript
{code}
```

Tested function/class: {target_name}

Unit test template:
```javascript
{test_template}
```

Test case description: {test_case}

Output only the test function, not the whole unit test file in the format below:
```javascript
it('[test_case_description]', () => {
    // test code
});
```
