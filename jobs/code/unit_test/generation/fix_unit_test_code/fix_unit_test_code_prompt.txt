## Task: Fix unit test code for a JS function using test results

## Tested code extract:
```javascript
{code}
```

## Unit test code:
```javascript
{test_code}
```

## Test execution output:
```txt
{test_results}
```

## Requirements:
1. Carefully read the unit test code and the test execution output
2. Fix the existing unit test code
3. If there are recursive calls to the function being tested, do not mock the tested function itself and try to handle the recursion in the test
4. Verify that jest.mock is not used to mock the whole module (as the given module paths are placeholders), instead use jest.spyOn to mock specific functions
5. Only the code inside the test function can be modified
6. Output only the fixed test function
